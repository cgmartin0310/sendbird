# Chat Channel Display Fix

## Problem
Care TeamMember was not appearing in the chat UI even though:
- ✅ They had valid consent
- ✅ They were added to the conversation in the database
- ✅ They were added to the Sendbird channel
- ✅ They existed as a Sendbird user

## Root Cause
The Chat component was using the basic `SendbirdApp` component without properly loading the specific channel from the URL parameter. This caused the UI to show a generic chat interface rather than the specific conversation with all its members.

## Solution
Refactored the Chat component to:
1. Use `useParams` to get the `channelUrl` from the route
2. Switch from `SendbirdApp` to a custom layout using:
   - `SendbirdProvider` for authentication
   - `ChannelList` for showing available channels
   - `Channel` for displaying the selected channel
3. Auto-select the channel from the URL parameter
4. Show a split view with channel list on left, chat on right

## Technical Details

### Before
```tsx
<SendbirdApp
  appId={appId}
  userId={userId}
  nickname={nickname}
/>
```

### After
```tsx
<SendbirdProvider appId={appId} userId={userId} nickname={nickname}>
  <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
    <ChannelList 
      onChannelSelect={(channel) => setCurrentChannelUrl(channel.url)}
      activeChannelUrl={currentChannelUrl}
    />
    <Channel channelUrl={currentChannelUrl} />
  </div>
</SendbirdProvider>
```

## Verification Steps
1. Create a conversation with multiple members
2. Click "View Chat" from the conversations list
3. You should now see:
   - Channel list on the left showing all conversations
   - The selected conversation on the right
   - All members listed in the channel members area
   - Care TeamMember properly displayed

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/Chat.tsx` - Complete refactor to use split view layout

## Related Scripts
- `npm run check:sendbird-channel` - Verify channel membership
- `npm run debug:conversation-creation` - Debug conversation creation flow

## Status
✅ FIXED - Care TeamMember now properly appears in chat conversations
