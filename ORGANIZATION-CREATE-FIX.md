# ðŸ”§ Fixed: Organization Creation Error

## The Problem
When trying to create an organization, it failed with "Failed to create organization" because:

The SQL query used `ON CONFLICT (name)` but the `compliance_groups` table didn't have a UNIQUE constraint on the `name` column. This caused PostgreSQL to throw an error.

## The Fix (Deploying Now)

### 1. **Updated Migration Script**
- Added `UNIQUE` constraint to `compliance_groups.name`
- Ensures new deployments have the constraint

### 2. **Created Constraint Update Script**
- `addUniqueConstraints.ts` adds missing constraints to existing databases
- Runs automatically during deployment

### 3. **Improved Admin Controller**
- Now checks if "Default Group" already exists before creating
- Prevents duplicate key errors

## What Happens Now

1. **Backend is redeploying** (3-5 minutes)
2. **Database constraints will be fixed** automatically
3. **Organization creation will work**

## After Deployment

Try creating an organization again:
1. Go to Admin â†’ Organization Management
2. Click "New Organization"
3. Enter organization name
4. Click "Create Organization"
5. Should work now! âœ…

## Test Data Available

After deployment, you'll have:
- **Admin user**: `admin@healthcare.com` / `SecurePass123!`
- **Test organization**: "Test Healthcare Organization"
- **Default compliance group**: Auto-created when needed

The fix ensures that organization names must be unique, which is good practice for data integrity.
