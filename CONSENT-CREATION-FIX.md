# Consent Creation Fix

## Problem Fixed
The consent creation form was missing the "Consent Type" dropdown, causing validation failures when trying to create consents.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Consent Type Dropdown
- Now includes common healthcare consent types:
  - HIPAA Authorization
  - Treatment Consent  
  - Information Sharing
  - Research Participation
  - Marketing Communications

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Better display of validation errors
- Debug logging to console for troubleshooting
- Shows specific field validation errors

### 3. Form Behavior
- Removed automatic consent type setting from compliance group
- Proper form reset when canceling
- All required fields are now properly validated

## How to Create a Consent

1. **Navigate to Admin â†’ Consents**
2. **Click "Create New Consent"**
3. **Fill in all required fields:**
   - Patient (dropdown)
   - Patient's Organization (dropdown)
   - Consent Type (dropdown) - **NEW!**
   - Consent Date
   - Expiry Date (optional)
   - Specific Organization (if required by compliance group)
   - Attachment (if needed)

4. **Click "Create Consent"**

## Debug Information

When creating a consent, check the browser console for:
- `Sending consent data:` - Shows the payload being sent
- `Create consent error:` - Shows any validation errors

## Common Issues

### "Failed to create consent"
- Check that all required fields are filled
- Look at console for specific validation errors
- Ensure you selected a consent type from the dropdown

### Validation Errors
The form will now show specific validation errors like:
- "Patient ID is required"
- "Organization ID is required"
- "Consent type is required"
- "Valid consent date is required"

## Testing After Deployment

1. Wait ~5 minutes for deployment
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Try creating a consent with all fields filled
4. Check console if any issues occur

## Next Steps

Once consents are created:
1. Care team members will have proper authorization
2. They will appear in conversation member lists
3. HIPAA compliance will be properly tracked
