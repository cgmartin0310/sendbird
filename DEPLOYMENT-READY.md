# 🎉 Frontend Build Issues Fixed!

## What Was Causing "Exited with status 2"

1. **TypeScript Error**: Unused `channelUrl` variable with strict checking
2. **Tailwind CSS v4**: Required updated PostCSS configuration
3. **Missing Package**: Needed `@tailwindcss/postcss` for new Tailwind version

## All Fixed! ✅

- Removed unused variables
- Updated PostCSS configuration
- Added required dependencies
- Build succeeds locally

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Add Sendbird App ID

Your frontend will deploy but **chat won't work** without this:

1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Static Site
2. Click **Environment** tab
3. Add:
   ```
   VITE_SENDBIRD_APP_ID = YOUR_ACTUAL_APP_ID_HERE
   ```
4. Get your App ID from: https://dashboard.sendbird.com

## Deployment Status

- All fixes pushed to GitHub ✅
- Render is auto-deploying now
- Build should complete successfully
- Frontend will be live at your Render URL

## Quick Test After Deploy

1. Visit your frontend URL
2. Register/Login
3. Create a patient
4. Try to create a conversation
5. If chat doesn't load → Check Sendbird App ID
