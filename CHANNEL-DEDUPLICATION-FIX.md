# Channel Deduplication Fix

## Problem
Multiple conversations with the same members were sharing messages because Sendbird was reusing the same channel instead of creating unique ones.

## Root Cause
The `is_distinct` parameter in Sendbird's channel creation API controls deduplication:
- `is_distinct: true` - Reuses existing channel if one exists with the same members
- `is_distinct: false` - Always creates a new unique channel

The service wasn't explicitly setting this parameter, which could lead to unpredictable behavior.

## Solution
1. **Explicitly set `is_distinct: false`** in the conversation controller
2. **Ensure the service properly passes this parameter** to the Sendbird API

## Code Changes

### src/controllers/conversationController.ts
```typescript
const channel = await sendbirdService.createGroupChannel({
  name: title,
  userIds: sendbirdUserIds,
  customType: 'care_team_conversation',
  data: channelData,
  isDistinct: false  // Explicitly set to ensure unique channels
});
```

### src/services/sendbirdService.ts
```typescript
is_distinct: params.isDistinct !== undefined ? params.isDistinct : false
```

## How to View All Members in Chat

In the Sendbird UI, members might not be immediately visible. To see all members:

1. **Look at the channel header** - It should show the member count
2. **Click on the channel name or settings icon** (⚙️) in the header
3. **This opens the channel settings** where you can see:
   - List of all members
   - Option to add/remove members
   - Other channel settings

## Testing the Fix

1. Create two conversations with the same members but different names
2. Send a message in one conversation
3. Switch to the other conversation
4. The message should NOT appear there (each conversation is now isolated)

## Verification Scripts

- `npm run check:sendbird-channel` - Verify channel members
- `npm run test:channel-creation` - Test channel creation behavior (requires env vars)

## Status
✅ FIXED - Each conversation now gets its own unique Sendbird channel
